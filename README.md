### Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis
# Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze and evaluate the cost and profitability of food delivery services. It breaks down delivery-related expenses (e.g., delivery fees, packaging, discounts, and restaurant commissions) against revenue from customer orders, allowing an assessment of per-order profitability. The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize operational efficiency and improve profitability.

Features
Data Collection: Imports, cleans, and preprocesses data on order volumes, revenues, and costs.
Cost and Revenue Breakdown: Extracts detailed insights into delivery costs, packaging, discounts, and commissions.
Profitability Calculation: Calculates per-order profitability and aggregates financial performance.
Trend Analysis: Tracks trends over time, highlighting seasonal and periodic patterns.
Financial Simulations: Runs simulations to assess the impact of financial adjustments (e.g., changes in discount rates).
Project Structure
data/: Contains the raw data files for order volumes, costs, and revenues.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and model development.
src/: Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis.
output/: Processed data and analysis results.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
Installation
